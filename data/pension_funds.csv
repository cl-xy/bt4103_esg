1256,AP7,The transition risk is therefore a consequence of societal measures taken to manage the physical climate risks.,2019.0
1257,AP7,"The transition risk is counted as a ﬁnancial risk, as the value of certain companies will fall when measures are implemented to, for example, phase out fossil fuels from the economy.",2019.0
1258,AP7,This would mean that the physical effects of climate change would harm the global growth and economy.,2019.0
1259,AP7,The economic values at risk of being lost if the climate risks are not managed successfully are astronomical.,2019.0
1260,AP7,"Research has been unable to prove that, when investors divest from companies in their equity portfo- lios, this has any effects on companies’ climate impact.",2019.0

1637,GPF,"Total emissions and our percentage share Based on our percentage holdings in each company, the fund accounted for total emissions of 107 million tonnes of CO2-equivalents in 2018.",2018.0
1638,GPF,This is around twice the amount of Norway’s total emissions in 2017 as reported by Statistics Norway.,2018.0
1639,GPF,"The reason for this is an increase in companies’ emissions, as can be seen from an increase of 6 percent in emissions for the reference benchmark.",2018.0
1640,GPF,The emissions of the companies in the equity portfolio was about the same as in the benchmark portfolio.,2018.0
1641,GPF,"These emissions are driven largely by sectors with high energy consumption, such as commodities, heavy industry, metals, oil and gas and power.",2018.0
1642,GPF,"Within these high-emission sectors, there are in turn a number of large companies that account for the bulk of emissions.",2018.0
1643,GPF,We have also calculated what the emissions of the companies in the benchmark index’s would have been without any ethical exclusions under the Ministry of Finance’s guidelines for observation and exclusion.,2018.0
1644,GPF,"These exclusions have reduced the benchmark index’s carbon emissions by 14 percent, due mainly to exclusions under the coal criterion.",2018.0
1645,GPF,"When reporting our share of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions, we multiply each company’s emissions by our percentage holding in that company.",2018.0
1646,GPF,We can then obtain a figure for the fund’s share of total greenhouse gas emissions for all companies in the portfolio by adding together the results for each individual company.,2018.0
1647,GPF,The emissions calculated for the FTSE Global All Cap are the total for all companies in the index excluding Norway.,2018.0
1648,GPF,Emission intensity Then companies in our equity portfolio emitted around 187 tonnes of CO2-equivalents for every million dollars of revenue.,2018.0
1649,GPF,We calculate companies’ emission intensity by dividing the emissions of an individual company by its revenue.,2018.0

3530,AP4,21 AP4 works with two focus areas in its investments - Climate & Environment and Corporate Governance.,2018.0
3531,AP4,"Among other distinctions, in 2018 AP4 was named as the world’s leading pen- sions fund in the climate area by the Asset Owners Disclosure Project (AODP).",2018.0
3532,AP4,"By taking responsibility as an owner and reducing climate risks in the portfolio, AP4 can contri- bute to higher long-term sustainable returns.",2018.0
3533,AP4,"Since previously AP4 has opted to not invest in companies involved in the production of tobacco, cannabis, mines or cluster munitions, or in companies in which thermal coal accounts for more than 20% of sales.",2018.0
3534,AP4,Thermal coal and oil sand AP4 does not invest in companies for which thermal coal or oil sand account for more than 20% of sales.,2018.0
3535,AP4,"Thermal coal and oil sand are fossil energy sources with high CO2 intensity per energy unit, and AP4 believes that these must be phased out in a global transition to a low-fossil society in line with the UN’s Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement.",2018.0
3536,AP4,"On top of this, AP4 applies low-carbon strategies for global equities, entailing the AP4 is reducing its exposure to the companies in each sector that have high CO2 intensity or fossil fuel reserves.",2018.0
3537,AP4,"24 Focus area: Climate & Environment Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, affecting essentially all states, sectors and com- panies.",2018.0
3538,AP4,Climate change will have a growing impact on asset values and the opportunity to generate returns over the long term.,2018.0
3539,AP4,The world’s ability to curb climate change is therefore a precondition for stable future economic growth and thus for AP4’s ability to fulfil its mission over time.,2018.0
3540,AP4,AP4 supports TCFD AP4 believes that transparent reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities contributes to a faster transition to a low fossil fuel society.,2018.0
3541,AP4,"A rapid transition is necessary to minimise climate- related risks and negative impacts on the ecosystem, societies and economies.",2018.0
3542,AP4,"AP4 supports climate reporting in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), both for investors and for portfolio companies.",2018.0
3543,AP4,"AP4’s climate reporting therefore adheres to the TCFD’s recommenda- tions with respect to four thematic areas: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.",2018.0
3544,AP4,"AP4’s board of directors has adopted a Sustainability Policy that describes the work on integrating sustainability in asset management, where Climate & Environment is one of AP4’s two focus areas.",2018.0
3545,AP4,During 2018 the Board addressed sustainability and the climate issue at five of the year’s six board meetings.,2018.0
3546,AP4,The Board has assigned the CEO with the task of conti- nuously assessing and addressing climate-related issues in the asset management.,2018.0
3547,AP4,AP4 therefore integrates sustainability broadly in its asset management and works with Climate & Environment as a special focus area.,2018.0
3548,AP4,AP4’s fundamental principles for implementation of Climate & Environment are: • Broad implementation of risk-mitigation strategies in AP4’s portfolio.,2018.0
3549,AP4,"AP4 applies low-carbon strategies in global equities, entailing that AP4 reduces its exposure to the companies in each sector that have high CO2 intensity or fossil fuel reserves.",2018.0
3550,AP4,This reduces the CO2 intensity in AP4’s portfolio and thus its exposure to climate-related transition risks.,2018.0
3551,AP4,AP4 searches actively and has made a number of investments focused on contributing to or benefiting from the shift to a low-carbon economy that is currently taking place.,2018.0
3552,AP4,25 Goals for following up integration of sustainability and the Climate & Environment focus area Integrating sustainability aspects associated with the climate and environment in asset management has high priority.,2018.0
3553,AP4,"AP4 shall: 1 Increase the share of investments that lower climate risk in the asset portfolio During the year, the share of investments that lower climate risk in the asset portfolio increased to 32% of AP4’s global equity investments.",2018.0
3554,AP4,"In addition, during 2018 AP4 sold companies with significant operations in thermal coal and oil sand.",2018.0
3555,AP4,for Climate & Environment in AP4’s assets 2 Map out quantitative and qualitative indicators Work continuously to map out complementary indicators for Climate & Environment — both quantitative and qualitative — which can be used in asset management.,2018.0
3556,AP4,"More indicators for climate risk are necessary as a complement to measuring carbon footprint, which shows only part of the exposure to climate risk in the asset portfolio.",2018.0
3557,AP4,4 5 Scenario analysis of climate-related risks and opportunities for AP4’s assets Work in this area continued in 2018 and culminated in an analysis of current research findings and a study of thematic investment areas in sustainability.,2018.0
3558,AP4,6 Spread knowledge about sustainability 3 Measure and disclose AP4’s carbon footprint Reporting the carbon footprint of listed equities is one way of illustrating climate risk.,2018.0
3559,AP4,The asset management organisation allocates time to share its knowledge and experience about low-carbon strategies and green bonds with other institutional investors.,2018.0
3560,AP4,These strategies reduce exposure to companies with the rela- tively largest CO2 emissions and fossil fuel reserves.,2018.0
3561,AP4,AP4 believes that good information and qualitative basic data and standardised reporting are prerequisites and a challenge for its ability to develop climate-related investment strategies.,2018.0
3562,AP4,Risk management AP4 has determined climate risks to be financial risks to the utmost degree and believes they should be included and assessed in the same way as other financial risks.,2018.0
3563,AP4,"In the shift to a low-fossil society, AP4 believes among other things that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will lead to rising costs for companies.",2018.0
3564,AP4,Compa- nies with large GHG emissions and/or fossil fuel reserves will be negatively affected and will be valued and priced differently than they are today.,2018.0
3565,AP4,Climate risks therefore lend themselves to being included in financial investment assessments with long-term investment horizons.,2018.0
3566,AP4,"As early as 2011, AP4 identified climate change as one of the largest long-term risks for AP4’s mission and asset portfolio.",2018.0
3567,AP4,These investments mitigate climate risk in AP4’s assets by reducing exposure to companies with the relatively largest CO2 emissions and fossil fuel reserves.,2018.0
3568,AP4,AP4 is working continuously on further developing strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of its investments.,2018.0
3569,AP4,"During 2018 AP4 conducted specific analyses, which have led to AP4 divesting assets in fossil-based energy sources with high CO2 intensity, such as thermal coal and oil sand.",2018.0
3570,AP4,The goal is also to broaden its strategies to also include resource efficiency in a broader perspective on top of carbon footprint.,2018.0
3571,AP4,AP4 believes that it is important to be an active and responsible owner that influences companies to increase their awareness about and transparency in reporting climate-related risks.,2018.0
3572,AP4,"At these AGMs, 52 of a total of 372 shareholder proposals were related to the climate or renewable energy.",2018.0
3573,AP4,During the past year AP4 voted in favour of shareholder proposals calling for greater transparency surrounding climate reporting and influence on the operations of companies involved in fossil energy.,2018.0
3574,AP4,"AP4 supports the Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) and the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), among other organisations.",2018.0
3575,AP4,"Initiatives focusing on climate change that AP4 supports include the Montreal Pledge and Climate Action 100+, an initiative directed at the 100 companies with the largest CO2 emissions, where AP4 has engaged three companies in a dialogue: Daimler, Engie and Volkswagen.",2018.0
3576,AP4,"Metrics and targets AP4 measures and publishes its carbon footprint, and together with other AP Funds has standardised how the AP Funds conduct their carbon footprint reporting.",2018.0
3577,AP4,"AP4 uses climate-related metrics for its low-carbon investments, which contribute to reductions in the assets’ climate risk.",2018.0
3578,AP4,Having access to qualitative basic data is a challenge and precondition for being able to evaluate climate-smart strategies.,2018.0
3579,AP4,AP4 uses both externally published targets and internal targets for steering and following up the integration of sustaina- bility in the asset management operations within the Climate & Environment focus area.,2018.0
3580,AP4,AP4 is reducing climate risk in the portfolio AP4 aims to increase the share of investments that reduce the climate risk in its portfolio.,2018.0
3581,AP4,"This is done by adhering to low-carbon strategies in the equity portfolio, through which AP4 – for each sector – is reducing its exposure to companies with high CO2 emissions or fossil fuel reserves.",2018.0
3582,AP4,"This is partly countered by that fact that AP4 also has significant exposure to shares in emerging markets, which generally have a higher CO2 intensity than those in develo- ped markets.",2018.0
3583,AP4,27 Contribution to CO2 reduction Absolute CO2 footprint and certain measures of CO2 intensity were higher at year-end 2018 than at the start of the year.,2018.0
3584,AP4,"The increase is due in part to the fact that AP4 increased its allocation to emerging markets during the year, which generally have higher CO2 intensity than developed markets.",2018.0
3585,AP4,"In addition, the weak performance of the world’s stock markets during the year entailed that CO2 intensity measured as companies’ CO2 footprint in relation to their market cap increased.",2018.0
3586,AP4,"However, the metric that AP4 applies in its portfolio structure – a mathematical average of CO2 intensity where the absolute carbon footprint is measure in relation to the companies’ revenues – continued to decrease during the year.",2018.0

3589,AP4,"28 Climate scenario analysis AP4’s analysis leads to the following, overarching long-term conclusions: • The earlier and more impactful the transition takes place, the smaller the physical risks will be, and vice versa.",2018.0
3590,AP4,"In the base scenario, a rapid cut in emissions by half would take place by 2050, and companies would be affected relatively more by the climate transition in itself and its effect on the companies’ business models than by higher, physical climate risks, even though they would also be expected to take place later.",2018.0
3591,AP4,"• Given that the transition risks are greater than the physical risks in the Fund’s basic scenario, the analysis is focused on the dynamics of the transition and its effect on companies, even though the physical climate risks are not negligible.",2018.0
3592,AP4,"The analysis comprises three steps, beginning with an overall analysis of current research findings about the effects of climate change on growth and inflation.",2018.0
3593,AP4,This forms the basis of a fundamental analysis of the potential financial effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on holdings in AP4’s portfolio.,2018.0
3594,AP4,"AP4’s climate scenario analysis does not set various scenarios against each other, but instead focuses on the dynamics of the climate transition based on the current situation.",2018.0
3595,AP4,"AP4’s conclusion of the research findings is that there is a negative correlation between climate change and growth, parti- cularly for specific sectors and geographies.",2018.0
3596,AP4,The fundamental climate analysis of the effect on the port- folio picks up where the analysis of the research findings ends and focuses on transitional risks as well as physical risks from various time perspectives.,2018.0
3597,AP4,"This, in turn, is in line with the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which shows that CO2 emissions must be cut in half by 2050 through a comparatively aggressive transition.",2018.0

3599,AP4,AP4’s low-carbon strategies in the global equity portfolio have resulted in a portfolio that has comparatively low and steadily decreasing exposure to fossil assets.,2018.0
3600,AP4,It’s largely a matter of reducing AP4’s exposure to carbon emissions and thereby reducing portfolio risk.,2018.0
3601,AP4,"We have identified three areas – the energy shift/mobility, resource efficiency and renewables – where we believe that the likelihood for a transition is significant at the same time that there are investment opportunities that are sufficiently mature and large for AP4 to be able to invest substantial capital and which offers an attractive return.",2018.0
3602,AP4,"Climate risk and the climate transition will have a significant impact on AP4’s portfolio over the long term, both concerning risks and opportunities.",2018.0

3889,GPF,"We sold shares in high emitting companies to finance our environmental investments, which typically have lower emissions.",2020.0

3891,GPF,"Within these high-emission 71 72 Our analysis show that oil and gas, industrial and consumer goods companies have the highest value chain emissions.",2020.0
3892,GPF,We have also calculated what the carbon footprint of the companies in the benchmark index would have been without any ethical exclusions under the Ministry of Finance’s guidelines for observation and exclusion.,2020.0
3893,GPF,"These exclusions have reduced the benchmark index’s carbon footprint by 18 percent, due mainly to exclusions under the coal criterion.",2020.0
3894,GPF,Carbon intensity The companies in our equity portfolio emitted around 133 tonnes of CO2-equivalents for every million US dollars of revenue.,2020.0
3895,GPF,"The difference can largely be put down to our investments in basic materials, industrials and utilities having a lower carbon intensity than the companies in the benchmark index.",2020.0
3896,GPF,"By way of comparison, the equity portfolio’s carbon intensity was 24 percent lower than that of the FTSE Global All Cap.",2020.0

3898,GPF,It is worth noting that carbon intensity is affected by changes in the prices of the products companies sell.,2020.0
3899,GPF,"For example, an oil company’s carbon intensity will decrease when oil prices rise, even if its emissions are constant.",2020.0

3902,GPF,"The data we use are largely model-based, and double counting and different methodological starting points mean that they cannot be included directly in the analysis of direct and indirect emissions.",2020.0
3903,GPF,"They nevertheless provide useful information, especially when we compare companies within a sector to identify which ones have the highest emissions.",2020.0
3904,GPF,"For example, a carmaker that produces electric cars will be very different to one that mainly produces conventional cars when we also look at emissions in the value chain.",2020.0
3905,GPF,"Our analysis show that oil and gas, industrial and consumer goods companies have the highest value chain emissions.",2020.0
3906,GPF,We can also see that value chain emissions in these sectors are much higher than direct emissions and emissions from their energy use.,2020.0
3907,GPF,Emissions in the corporate bond portfolio The corporate bond portfolio’s carbon intensity is 14 percent below that of the benchmark index.,2020.0
3908,GPF,This is mainly because our investments in industrial companies have a lower carbon intensity than the benchmark index.,2020.0

4390,AP2,The carbon footprint’s limitations Does not measure the investments’ total climate impact because: – Only certain emissions are included – Emissions data from companies are not complete – Only certain types of asset classes are measured – Savings on emissions through products and services are not calculated – Information on fossil reserves is not included.,2017.0
4391,AP2,"Does not measure a portfolio’s total climate risks, such as physical risks in the event of extreme weather, floods and droughts, or, for example, consequences of increasing legislation on energy efficiency.",2017.0
4392,AP2,Carbon footprints are not a measure of a portfolio’s total climate options or how well a portfolio is positioned against a transition to a low-carbon society.,2017.0
4393,AP2,A unilateral focus on individual portfolios’ reduced carbon footprints therefore risks drawing attention from actual emission reductions and how investors can provide solutions for a low carbon dioxide economy.,2017.0
4394,AP2,"53 For 2017, the Fund has not calculated the absolute carbon footprint from corporate bonds because the Fund changed the system in which the carbon footprint is calculated.",2017.0
