we have been part of a working group alongside five other sovereign wealth funds to develop a framework for integrating opportunities and managing risks in investment portfolios in the transition to a low-carbon economy', ' The premise for the framework is that a sovereign wealth fund has a long investment horizon and should therefore take account of the long-term effects of climate change in its strategy', ' The funds in the working group called on portfolio companies to manage climate risks and report on the actions they are taking', ' The funds will integrate risks and opportunities from climate change into their investment strategies in line with their respective mandates', 'The working group has continued to work on exchanging experience of how large sovereign wealth funds can manage opportunities and risks from climate change, partly through expectations of external managers, use of climate scenarios and measurement of carbon footprints', ' Climate information for the financial sector We expect the companies we invest in to consider the sensitivity of their long-term business strategy and profitability to future climate scenarios', ' Most of the group’s work has involved developing analytical tools to assess portfolio risks and opportunities in different future climate scenarios', ' UNEP has chosen the supplier Carbon Delta to contribute to the development of models and perform various scenario analyses for the project', ' Our work on sustainability draws on statistics and data for countries and sectors as well as data on specific topics such as corruption, executive remuneration, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and human rights', ' Climate risk disclosure In 2016, we developed our own framework to increase our understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities in the fund', 'The portfolio’s climate-related risks may be either physical risks or financial risks related to companies’ transition to a low-carbon economy', ' The price of the assets an investor buys, and the degree to which this price reflects climate risks, affects the financial risks', ' A broadly diversified and market-weighted portfolio will, in principle, have roughly the same financial climate risks as the underlying markets and sectors in which it is invested', ' In our work on assessing companies, we have focused on producers of cement, chemicals, oil and gas, power and steel, as they are exposed to particularly high climate risks', 'Climate scenariosScenario analyses are useful for exploring the consequences of different actions, whether passive or active', ' Ideally, the scenarios should be based on well-founded assumptions about future greenhouse gas emissions, physical climate changes and macroeconomic conditions', ' We are working on developing a number of different methodological tools for climate scenarios that can give us a broad and deep understanding of where and how climate risk might affect individual companies and the portfolio as a whole', ' For example, we look at future cash flows and carbon emissions at company level, and also at how possible future regulation in the form of carbon pricing and carbon quotas might impact on different companies, sectors and regions', ' The aim of this work is eventually to be able to understand how climate risks could affect portfolio returns', ' This analysis provides an insight into the level of greenhouse gas emissions from the companies we are invested in', ' It can also provide an insight into risks and opportunities across sectors and shed light on how changes to the fund’s mandate affect its carbon footprint', 'We follow the recommendations for asset managers from the TCFD when calculating the fund’s carbon footprint', ' We start from the greenhouse gas emissions of each individual company in the equity portfolio, measured as tonnes of CO2-equivalents', ' These emission data are supplied by analysis firm Trucost and cover companies’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions', ' At portfolio level, we calculate emissions in three ways – based on holding, revenue and market value', ' This analysis of greenhouse gas emissions provides only a snapshot for 2018, however, and does not take account of companies’ strategy, industry structure and other factors', ' In this analysis, only 17 percent of companies disclosed data on greenhouse gas emissions directly in 93Chart 11 Data on greenhouse gas emission of Chart 11 Data on greenhouse gas emission of companies', ' For 8 percent of companies, emissions have been estimated simply on the basis of the median for their sector', 'Total emissions and our percentage shareBased on our percentage holdings in each company, the fund accounted for total emissions of 107 million tonnes of CO2-equivalents in 2018', ' This is around twice the amount of Norway’s total emissions in 2017 as reported by Statistics Norway', ' The reason for this is an increase in companies’ emissions, as can be seen from an increase of 6 percent in emissions for the reference benchmark', ' The emissions of the companies in the equity portfolio was about the same as in the benchmark portfolio', 'These emissions are driven largely by sectors with high energy consumption, such as commodities, heavy industry, metals, oil and gas and power', ' Within these high-emission sectors, there are in turn a number of large companies that account for the bulk of emissions', ' We have also calculated what the emissions of the companies in the benchmark index’s would have been without any ethical exclusions under the Ministry of Finance’s guidelines for observation and exclusion', ' These exclusions have reduced the benchmark index’s carbon emissions by 14 percent, due mainly to exclusions under the coal criterion', 'When reporting our share of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions, we multiply each company’s emissions by our percentage holding in that company', ' We can then obtain a figure for the fund’s share of total greenhouse gas emissions for all companies in the portfolio by adding together the results for each individual company', ' The emissions calculated for the FTSE Global All Cap are the total for all companies in the index excluding Norway', ' We calculate companies’ emission intensity by dividing the emissions of an individual company by its revenue', ' For example, an oil company’s emission intensity will decrease when oil prices rise, even if the size of its emissions is constant', '1Table 5 Scope 1 and 2 emissions by sector as at 31 December 2018 Equity

companies, sectors and managers', ' Emissions and market valueThe equity portfolio emitted 164 tonnes of CO2-equivalents for every million dollars in market value', 'We report greenhouse gas emissions in relation to companies’ market value by dividing each company’s emissions by its market value', ' In the same way as for emission intensity, we weight emissions by the size of our investment and add them together to compare the sectors in our portfolio', ' This metric can give investors useful information for comparing the carbon footprint of equity investments across sectors and companies', ' This means that external factors unrelated to greenhouse gas emissions can result in differences between two otherwise identical companies', ' For example, a decline in a company’s share price will increase its emissions by market value even if its actual emissions are unchanged', 'Emissions in the corporate bond portfolioThe bond portfolio’s emission intensity is 16 percent below that of the

Investments’ efforts to directly factor climate-related risks and opportunities into the organization’s investment strategy and total portfolio design', ' The team quantified climate-related physical and transition risk impacts on the economies of the countries we invest in, and the resulting impacts across different potential ETCC scenarios on our portfolio', '• Our Risk Group continued to refine our in-house carbon footprint tool to more accurately measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with CPP Investments’ holdings', ' It also introduced carbon emission metrics for government issued securities (refer to page 53) and researched and applied various climate change benchmarks and stress-testing methodologies, including the Bank of England’s climate change stress test (see pages 50–51)', '• Our bottom-up Security Selection Framework was used to screen over 100 transactions for climate-related risks and opportunities', ' The framework allows investment teams and approval committees to assess material impacts from climate change against the value of these investments (see page 51)', '• Climate change investment opportunities were researched and pursued through a variety of strategies including: – the Thematic Investing group’s Climate Change Opportunities (CCO) strategy (see pages 22–23); – the Energy & Resources team’s Innovation, Technology & Services (ITS) strategy and work on carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) (see page 24); and – the Power & Renewables (P&R) group’s expansion of our renewable energy portfolio through additional acquisitions (see page 26)', '• Expanded climate-related financial disclosures in our annual and sustainable investing reports in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (see pages 50–55)', 'Climate Change and the Energy Industry’s EvolutionWe view climate change as among the major challenges of our time', ' A

and defined', ' This means we have an ongoing responsibility to be a leader in understanding the risks posed, and opportunities presented, by climate change', 'The combined forces of technological advances, changing policy, and shifts in consumer and business spending are accelerating the global shift to lower-carbon energy sources – all while worldwide energy demand is projected to grow', ' This is evident in the way we incorporate climate change risks and opportunities into our investment strategy and deploy capital into areas like renewable energy', ' Additionally, we use our influence to support better climate change practices and disclosure at portfolio companies', ' The projected scale of the investment needed to shift to a lower-carbon global economy means many ventures require backing from strong, knowledgeable, long-term partners', ' For this reason, CPP Investments’ approach to climate change is focused on understanding and acting on the energy industry’s dynamic evolution, rather than a static set of targets, and allows us to capitalize on a multitude of opportunities', ' Carbon capture and storage technologies are advancing and, depending partly on policy decisions, could also play a significant role in reducing emissions from carbon-based energy sources', 'The revised Policy on Sustainable Investing achieves the following:• updates and aligns the language with our legislative objectives;• conveys that the integration of ESG factors is inextricably linked to CPP Investments’ ability to successfully achieve our objectives, and portfolio companies’ abilities to create and sustain shareholder value; • is more specific about our approach to engagement;• signals our expectations of material ESG disclosure by companies, including our

objective to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045', ' Our low-carbon strategies, which we began implementing as far back as 2012 and have subsequently developed year for year since then, took additional steps in 2020', ' More specifically, our strategies for selecting companies in the global equities portfolio now also include data on whether the companies are considered to be aligned with the Paris Agreement and on their ability to manage pricing of carbon emissions', ' During 2020 we also broadened our application of low-carbon strategies to our entire internally man-aged global equities portfolio', ' This means that the target we set in 2015 ahead of the Paris summit – that the entire global equities portfolio would be managed based on strategies that result in a lower carbon footprint – has now been achieved', 'Ensuring that the currently ongoing climate transition will be implementable over the long term requires that it is possible to unite societal and economic development that is perceived to be socially acceptable', ' Responsible use of fossil fuels within the framework of the remaining CO2 budget – mainly conventional oil and natural gas – will therefore continue to be a precondition for a successful transition to a climate-neutral society', ' The latter is important, as several fossil fuel–based companies in the future will be among the largest investors in the world in renewable energy and will thereby be positioned to play a key role in the climate transition', '""With said measures, during 2020 AP4 reduced the carbon foot-print in its

climate tran-sition and its impact on various industries, specifically the energy sector', ' The baseline for the analysis is that the goals of the Paris Agreement are reached, which means that annual global greenhouse gas emissions must start to be reduced relatively immediately and at a fast pace', ' AP4 believes that the single most important tool for creating tangible economic incentives that could affect all actors in society is global pricing of greenhouse gas emissions', ' Today, greenhouse gas emissions rep-resent a societal cost that the actors who are most responsible for the emissions often are not held to account', ' This must change for a successful climate transition to be possible, and the pricing will need to be complemented with support for the groups and regions that would be negatively impacted', 'In the transition that has now begun, reduced emissions can be put in relation to economic growth and societal development in general as well as to the fight against poverty', ' To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is therefore essential that the remaining carbon budget is used wisely', ' Thermal coal that is used to produce electricity and heat is the energy source which, relative to oil and gas, emits the most carbon dioxide per produced unit of energy', ' Coal is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and also the energy source with the largest existing reserves, for which there is no scope in a global carbon budget', 'The climate scenario analysis also serves as the foundation for the Board’s decisions on medium-term return targets and strategic asset allocation through the Dynamic Normal Portfolio (DNP) and is thereby integrated in AP4’s overall business environment analysis', 'Thematic sustainability analysisThe climate scenario analysis describes the potential financial risks and opportunities at the sector level and thereby has an influence on the analysis of sustainability themes and, by extension, specific investments, companies and sector selection in the operative asset management', ' The thematic analysis is about understanding how the climate transition affects value chains in various industries and sectors', ' Forward-looking climate data in global equities managementDuring 2020 the quantitative company analysis in low-carbon strategies in the global equities management introduced new, forward-looking data sources pertaining to companies’ actions in relation to the Paris Agreement and their ability to manage carbon pricing', ' Together these now form the basis for divesting

general challenge facing analyses of climate risk is the limited availability of high-quality and relevant data', 'Climate scenariosScenario analyses are used to illustrate different future outcomes for climate risk and better understand climate risk over long time periods', ' These analyses can shed light on both physical and transition risks in the portfolio, but are based on factors that are often subject to considerable uncertainty, such as climate models, expected technological progress and potential regulatory changes', ' Ideally, the scenarios should be based on well-founded assumptions about future carbon emissions, physical climate changes and macroeconomic conditions', ' We are working on developing different methods and tools for climate scenarios that can give us a broad and deep understanding of how climate risk might affect individual companies and the portfolio as a whole', ' For example, we look at future cash flows and carbon emissions at company level, and at how possible future regulation in the form of carbon pricing and carbon quotas might impact different companies, industries and regions', ' The aim of this work is eventually to be able to understand how climate risks could affect portfolio returns', ' We are therefore working actively with companies that operate in industries with elevated climate risks to improve their reporting', '

on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) when calculating the fund’s carbon footprint', ' We start from the greenhouse gas emissions of each individual company in the equity portfolio, measured as tonnes of CO2-equivalents', ' These emissions data are supplied by analysis firm Trucost and cover companies’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions', ' At portfolio level, we calculate emissions in relation to the fund’s holding, revenue and market value', ' We report emissions data at sector level for the fund, for the benchmark index and for the FTSE Global All Cap index, which is the starting point for the benchmark index defined by the Ministry of Finance', ' This analysis of carbon emissions provides only a snapshot, however, and does not take account of companies’ strategy, industry structure and other factors', ' Emissions data are generally published in connection with a company’s annual report early the following year', ' When analysing emissions data for 2019, the most up-to-date numbers will therefore come from companies’ annual reports for 2018 published in 2019', ' Where a company has not published emissions data for 2018, we will use data reported for 2017 or estimates', ' In this analysis, 20 percent of companies disclosed data on carbon emissions directly in their reports or via CDP', ' For 8 percent of companies, emissions have been estimated simply on the basis of the median for their sector', 'Total emissions and our percentage shareBased on our percentage holdings in each company, the total emissions of the equity portfolio were108 million tonnes of CO2-equivalents in 2019', ' This is around twice Norway’s total emissions in 2018 of 52 million tonnes of CO2-equivalents as reported by Statistics Norway', ' The carbon footprint of the companies in our equity portfolio was at about the same level as in 2018', 'These emissions are driven largely by industries with high energy consumption, such as mining and metals, heavy industry, oil and gas, and power production', ' Within these high-emission industries, there are in turn a number of large companies that account for the bulk of emissions', ' We have also calculated what the carbon footprint of the companies in the benchmark index would have been without any ethical exclusions under the Ministry of Finance’s guidelines for observation and exclusion from the Government Pension Fund Global', ' These exclusions have reduced the benchmark index’s carbon footprint by 19 percent, due mainly to exclusions under the coal criterion', 'Carbon intensityThe companies in our equity portfolio emitted around 156 tonnes of CO2-equivalents for every 75million US dollars (USD) of revenue', ' The difference can largely be put down to our investments in industrials and utilities having a lower carbon intensity than the companies in the benchmark index', ' By way of comparison, the equity portfolio’s carbon intensity was 20 percent lower than that of the FTSE Global All Cap', ' 76The carbon intensity of the companies in the equity portfolio and the benchmark index decreased by 16 and 17 percent respectively from 2018 to 2019', ' It is worth noting that carbon intensity is affected by changes in the prices of the products companies sell', ' For example, an oil company’s carbon intensity will decrease when oil prices rise, even if its emissions are constant', ' Similarly, a company that sells luxury cars will have a lower carbon intensity than one that sells cheaper cars, even if both produce the same number of cars', 'To calculate the total carbon intensity of the companies in the portfolio, we weight each company’s carbon intensity by the value of our investment divided by the value of the entire equity portfolio', ' This is the metric recommended by the TCFD, because it makes it possible to compare emissions across companies, sectors and managers', ' Emissions and market valueThe companies in the equity portfolio emitted 129 tonnes of CO2-equivalents for every million US dollars (USD) of market value', ' The difference can be explained by our investments in industrials, basic materials and utilities having lower emissions in relation to their market value than the companies in the benchmark index', 'We report carbon emissions by market value by dividing each individual company’s emissions by its market value', ' This metric can give investors useful information for comparing the carbon footprint of equity investments across sectors and companies', ' This means that external factors unrelated to carbon emissions can result in differences between two otherwise identical companies', ' For example, a decline in a company’s share price will increase its emissions by market value even if its actual emissions are unchanged', 'Emissions in the corporate bond portfolioThe corporate bond portfolio’s carbon intensity is 13 percent below that of the benchmark index', ' This is mainly because our investments in industrial companies have a lower carbon intensity than the benchmark index', ' This lending does Table 5 Scope 1 and 2 emissions by sector as at 31 December 2019 Equity portfolioBenchmark indexFTSE Global All CapTonnes CO2

issue of responsible lobbying has gone from being a non-issue in the dialogue between investors and companies to becoming a natural part of investor analysis of how companies are work-ing on climate', ' Many business organisations drive a more negative climate lobbying than the companies that support them', ' These organisations have great inﬂuence over climate policy despite the companies’ official support for the Paris Agreement', ' We decided to focus our theme on an underlying reason for the climate transition not taking place sufficiently quickly: corporate lobbying against climate legislation', ' Companies should ensure that all climate policy engagement carried out by the company itself or by a member organisation supports the implementation of the Paris Agreement', ' Our objective with the theme was to increase knowledge about climate lobbying, and encourage more investors and companies to address the issue', ' Ahead of the Corporate Climate Lobbying theme, we asked the questions: How widespread is the problem of lobbying against climate legislation', ' In later phases, the work on corporate climate lobbying brought results in companies, and grew from being a non-issue to an issue that is driven at general meetings', ' The Corporate Climate Lobbying theme was launched in 2017 with a review of the political land-scape in terms of climate lobbying on different markets', ' The point of departure was the position that we, together with other investors, drew up and published in 2015: Investor Expectations on Corporate Climate Lobbying', ' In that

organisa-tions after reviewing their memberships and concluding that the companies and the interest organisations hold different positions on the climate issue', ' 17Together with many investors, we have called for companies to publish their memberships in interest organisations and positions on the climate issue', ' Currently, measurements focus more on measuring portfolios and giving the portfolios a value, such as carbon footprint or the number of women on boards', ' A portfolio with a low carbon footprint could give the impression that the portfolio contributes to positive societal effects through reduced emissions, but this is not the case', ' There is no evidence that investors that sell holdings in companies with large carbon emissions to reduce the carbon footprint of their 20portfolio contribute to actual emission reductions in the companies', ' If we are to achieve lower emissions, the companies must reduce their emissions and offer products or services that contribute to emission reductions', ' We therefore distinguish between the impact of the investor on society by working to support the companies in the transition and the companies’ impact on society by reducing

business in ways that conﬂict with the Paris Agreement, for example, by extracting oil in the Arctic or counteracting climate legislation', ' At present, there is no research indicating that a redistribution of investments from energy companies in the portfolio would help to reduce the physical global emissions of carbon', ' One example is companies’ climate lobbying, where resolutions that we have ﬁled together with other investors have led to companies reviewing their memberships of sector organisations that lobby against the incorporation of the Paris Agreement in legislation', ' Because AP7 utilises the opportunity afforded by its active asset management to ﬁnance businesses that offer solutions to the climate issue, AP7 has also increased its exposure to businesses that are

in listed equity, which comprises 88 percent of AP7’s total assets under management', ' The analysis was carried out by Your SRI/Southpole, and comprises emissions corresponding to Scope 1 and 2 according to the GHG Protocol', ' The calculations are based on 59 percent reported and 41 percent estimated emissions data from companies in the portfolio', ' The sector that contributed most to AP7’s carbon footprint was power supply, which accounted for 35 percent of the footprint', ' The absolute climate footprint of the AP7 Equity Fund, corresponding to the owned proportion of the companies’ collective emissions, was 8 million tonnes CO2e', ' This is in line with our comparison index, MSCI ACWI, whose total carbon footprint at the same point in time was 9 million tonnes of CO2e', ' The carbon intensity where the absolute carbon footprint is related to the ownership proportion of the companies’ market value for the AP7 Equity Fund, was 14 tonnes of CO2e per SEK million', ' The carbon intensity where the absolute carbon footprint is related to the ownership proportion of the companies’ revenues was 21 tonnes of CO2e per SEK million', ' The carbon intensity, weighted average, where the companies’ carbon intensity in relation to revenues is multiplied by the company’s percentage of the portfolio based on market value, was 38 tonnes CO2e per SEK million', ' Since 2015, AP7 and the buffer funds AP1-AP4 and AP6 have been collaborating in a group consisting of representatives from each AP fund, to coordinate the funds’ reporting of carbon footprint', ' Various data suppliers’ services regarding carbon indicators for different asset classes have been evaluated, and this area is being continually developed', ' AP7’s managed capital largely comprises listed assets, so we nevertheless report the climate footprint for approximately 90 percent of our investments as of 31 December 2019', ' In the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related

but also that there are some limitations', ' Advantages of the carbon footprint Provides a way to assess certain climate-related ﬁnancial risks, such as by putting a price on carbon', ' Limitations of the carbon footprint Does not measure the total impact of the investments because: – Only certain emissions are included – Emissions data from companies is not complete – Only certain asset classes are measured – Emissions savings through products and services are not included – Information about fossil reserves is not included Does not measure the total climate risks of a portfolio, such as physical risks associated with extreme weather, ﬂooding and drought, or conse-quences of more stringent legislation regarding greater energy efficiency', ' The carbon footprint is not a measure of a portfolio’s total climate oppor-tunities, nor how well a portfolio is positioned in relation to a transition to a low-carbon society', ' A unilateral focus on individual portfolios’ reduced carbon

of how the organization’s strategies might change to address potential climate-related risks and opportunities', ' It believes that scenario analysis is important for improving the disclosure of decision-useful, climate-related financial information', ' To better understand the risks posed by climate change, CPPIB is developing a climate-related scenario analysis framework both internally through a cross-functional approach involving experts in risk management and investments, as well as externally through investors’ collaboration platforms and consultation', 'The Total Portfolio

change risk scenarios or events, potential investment and non-investment impacts to CPPIB and controls that can be implemented to monitor and/or reduce the risk to CPPIB’s portfolio over various time horizons', ' However, CPPIB believes it is important to be an early adopter to gain a better understanding of the climate change risks to and opportunities for our portfolio', 'SIGNPOSTSTPM has developed an initial framework for using key indicators, or “signposts”, to monitor the energy transition and climate change', ' These signposts use recent trends in data to help inform our view on the likelihood of potential scenarios for overall energy demand, the shifting mix between traditional and renewable energy sources, and the physical effects of climate change, which we can summarize in terms of an overall warming signal', ' The insights provided will help the organization to better gauge the potential physical and transition risk impacts of climate change on both the global economy and our portfolio', ' The goal is to ensure CPPIB fulfills its mandate to maximize return without undue risk of loss by fully understanding climate change risks and opportunities', ' For example, we plan to expand our Physical Effects signposts so that we can better use them to warn us if we are under- or over-estimating the physical risk damages associated with climate change, or if we have reached an Earth system tipping point that is amplifying human impacts', ' DEMANDTechnology is an important determinant of growth in renewable generation and is a key economic driver of the energy transition and the path of emissions', ' Innovation has driven rapid declines in renewable energy and electric vehicle costs, dramatically improving their competitiveness compared with higher-carbon technologies', ' Tracking technology costs and penetration rates provides an important insight into the evolution of the energy system and future emissions', ' Carbon pricing is a key element of climate policy, and its adoption around the world helps us track current policy trends', ' More broadly, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are the foundation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and embody efforts by each signatory country to reduce national emissions', ' Current trends in energy production help us track where energy and emissions are moving over the near-term, while investment in different energy sources gives a clear line of sight into future generation capacity and the emissions associated with it', 'The Physical Effects signpost is designed to track the ongoing evolution of earth systems due to human activities, which is reflected in part through headline indicators like anthropogenic emissions and overall temperature change', '

' During Covid-19, I and certainly many others have been concerned that the world may not be able to focus on many important issues simultaneously, and that the climate transition would fall into the shadow of the pandemic', ' In recent years, this has led to several large energy and mining companies increasing their transparency on climate lobbying, and distancing themselves from trade organisations that conduct activities in conﬂict with the Paris Agreement', ' In order to attain the climate transition, we must globally reduce our use of coal as an energy source', ' If we are to attain the goal of keeping global warming well below two degrees, the energy companies must be part of the climate transition', ' The work must not slow down, because many of the world’s companies

companies around the world, AP7 is well aware that our climate risks are therefore the same as those in the overall global economy', ' Our managed assets total SEK 720 billion and, as a responsible owner, we must be able to overview and analyse how our investments are affected by climate change', ' In 2020, AP7 carried out a climate scenario analysis that provides a theoretical picture of what companies’ emissions would be like and how they would relate to the Paris Agreement if our current portfolio remained unchanged in the future', ' those companies that contribute with the largest emissions and thereby the risk of not meeting the 2°C target', ' The scenario analysis shows that 16 percent of the companies in the portfolio, based on company value, have undertaken to attain

companies in our portfolio that have the greatest absolute impact on climate, and that are making new investments in fossil-based activities in coal production and coal energy', ' At present, we cannot see how a divestment from energy companies in the portfolio would help to reduce the physical global emissions of carbon', ' One example is in climate lobbying, where together with other investors we have ﬁled resolutions that have led to companies reviewing their memberships of business organisations that engage in lobbying against the incorporation of the Paris Agreement in legislation', ' In AP7’s active asset management, we are utilising the opportunity to ﬁnance businesses that offer solutions to the climate issue', ' Reporting of climate-related risks Reporting of the underlying companies’ climate- related risks must be improved if these risks are to be managed', ' The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has had a great impact, and has become a pioneer for how companies can identify and report their climate-related ﬁnancial risks and opportunities', ' Companies are now blacklisted that have a large absolute impact on climate and that continue to make new investments in the coal industry, thereby making it difficult to attain the goals in the Paris Agreement', ' In the three-year duration of the theme, AP7 and other active owners have prompted many global companies to demand that their interest organisations’ lobbying be aligned with the Paris Agreement climate goals', 'As investors, we can provide funding for businesses that contribute solutions to various sustainability challenges, such as companies specialising in climate innovations', ' Through its voting, AP7 has ﬁrst and foremost promoted the issue of transparency regarding corporate lobbying and political advocacy, and climate reporting', ' In 2020, we ﬁled two resolutions on climate lobbying in the US that were taken up at the general meetings of

energy', ' Standard for good corporate climate lobbying AP7 is in a strong position to develop, together with TPI and other actors, new knowledge, and new norms in the market', ' The issue of corporate climate lobbying, which was a separate theme for AP7 in 2017-2019, has an epilogue within the framework of the new theme', ' The focus will lie on developing norms and, in collaboration with the London School of Economics, create a global standard for responsible corporate climate lobbying, which will be launched in the ﬁrst half of 2021', ' Soul Pattinson (New Hope Group) Yanzhou Coal

from the transition to a low-carbon society, where consumption patterns will be changed, new products replace old, and climate policy becomes more stringent', ' This is because the economic values at risk of being lost if the climate risks are not managed successfully are astronomical', ' Transition risks The process of phasing out fossil fuels from the economy and the transition to a more

therefore come from companies’ annual reports for 2019 published in 2020', ' In this analysis, 10 percent of emissions are taken directly from companies’ own reports or from CDP, and 55 percent are based on relevant information provided by companies', ' Total emissions and our percentage share Based on our percentage holdings in each company, the equity portfolio’s total emissions amounted to 92', ' We sold shares in high emitting companies to finance our environmental investments, which typically have lower emissions', 'These emissions are driven largely by industries with high energy consumption, such as mining and metals, heavy industry, oil and gas, and power production', ' Within these high-emission 7172Our analysis show that oil and gas, industrial and consumer goods companies have the highest value chain emissions', ' We have also calculated what the carbon footprint of the companies in the benchmark index would have been without any ethical exclusions under the Ministry of Finance’s guidelines for observation and exclusion', ' These exclusions have reduced the benchmark index’s carbon footprint by 18 percent, due mainly to exclusions under the coal criterion', ' Carbon intensity The companies in our equity portfolio emitted around 133 tonnes of CO2-equivalents for every million US dollars of revenue', ' The difference can largely be put down to our investments in basic materials, industrials and utilities having a lower carbon intensity than the companies in the benchmark index', ' By way of comparison, the equity portfolio’s carbon intensity was 24 percent lower than that of the FTSE Global All Cap', ' The carbon intensity of the companies in the equity portfolio and the benchmark index decreased by 15 and 10 percent respectively from 2019 to 2020', 'It is worth noting that carbon intensity is affected by changes in the prices of the products companies sell', ' For example, an oil company’s carbon intensity will decrease when oil prices rise, even if its emissions are constant', ' Similarly, a company that sells luxury cars will have a lower carbon intensity than one that sells cheaper cars, even if both produce the same number of cars', ' Emissions in the value chainIn 2020, we began to analyse emissions in the value chains of all of the companies in the portfolio, known as Scope 3 emissions', ' The data we use are largely model-based, and double counting and different methodological starting points mean that they cannot be included directly in the analysis of direct and indirect emissions', ' They nevertheless provide useful information, especially when we compare companies within a sector to identify which ones have the highest emissions', ' For example, a carmaker that produces electric cars will be very different to one that mainly produces conventional cars when we also look at emissions in the value chain', ' Our analysis show that oil and gas, industrial and consumer goods companies have the highest value chain emissions', ' We can also see that value chain emissions in these sectors are much higher than direct emissions and emissions from their energy use', 'Emissions in the corporate bond portfolio The corporate bond portfolio’s carbon intensity is 14 percent below that of the benchmark index', ' This is mainly because our investments in industrial companies have a lower carbon intensity than the benchmark index', ' To measure the carbon footprint of companies in the bond portfolio, we link the issuer of the bond to the parent company where the emissions actually occur', '
