7315,JPMORGAN,"The challenge we face today is twofold: We need to find ways to continue to generate energy for the world’s growing needs, including transportation, electricity and heating for homes and offices, and powering industry and manufacturing.",2020.0
7316,JPMORGAN,And we need to do so by using lower-carbon technologies so that the world can meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.,2020.0
7317,JPMORGAN,"Currently there are not adequate, commercially available low- carbon energy solutions for all of the world’s energy needs.",2020.0
7318,JPMORGAN,"Technologies like wind and solar have made huge strides, but they are principally deployed for electricity generation.",2020.0
7319,JPMORGAN,"13 And, even as this scales up, electricity generation still accounts for only about 44% of global carbon dioxide emissions.",2020.0
7320,JPMORGAN,"As a result, even as additional low-carbon technologies are developed and deployed over time, resources like oil and natural gas will continue to play a role in meeting essential global energy needs.",2020.0

7322,JPMORGAN,"15 This means that, for companies to succeed through energy transition — that is, become more efficient, innovate, evolve and stay competitive in a changing world — they will need significant capital and strategic support.",2020.0
7323,JPMORGAN,This means we are measuring the GHG emissions of our clients in key sectors of our financing portfolio (our “financed emissions”) and are setting reduction targets for these sector portfolios that are Paris-aligned.,2020.0

7325,JPMORGAN,Why We Made This Commitment Our commitment to Paris-alignment is an important step toward accelerating the low-carbon energy transition and encouraging near-term actions that will set a path for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.,2020.0
7326,JPMORGAN,"By working directly with clients to develop and finance their transition strategies and goals, we will help them navigate the challenges and opportunities of decarbonization and the energy transition, while also helping accelerate new technologies and business strategies.",2020.0

7329,JPMORGAN,Our Approach to Paris-Alignment JPMorgan Chase has developed Carbon CompassSM — our methodology to measure and track progress against our Paris- aligned targets.,2020.0
7330,JPMORGAN,"Our targets are based on credible third-party energy and emissions scenarios, such as the International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario (IEA SDS) and the Energy Technology Perspectives Beyond 2°C Scenario (ETP B2DS), which include specific glide paths to achieve Paris-aligned emissions.",2020.0
7331,JPMORGAN,"First, these sectors are each responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions in the global energy value chain, making them key to bringing overall emissions trajectories in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.",2020.0
7332,JPMORGAN,"Third, though improvements are needed, sufficient emissions data is emerging in each of these sectors.",2020.0
7333,JPMORGAN,"Finally, these sectors represent both the supply and demand side of the energy system, with oil and natural gas being key energy sources used by the power and automotive sectors.",2020.0
7334,JPMORGAN,"For example, a lower- carbon power grid is a key enabler of decarbonization in the auto sector, as electric vehicles are only truly low- or zero-emission if charged by lower carbon or renewably powered electricity.",2020.0
7335,JPMORGAN,"By starting with these three sectors, we are increasing full value chain accountability for decarbonization.",2020.0

7341,JPMORGAN,"To be effective, we know the metrics we use and the emissions we measure must be based on activities that generate the most GHG emissions for each sector and that are most important for each company’s transition pathway.",2020.0
7342,JPMORGAN,"For example, in the Oil & Gas sector, we include both operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions from the production and refining of oil and gas, and end-use (Scope 3) emissions associated with the ultimate combustion of that oil and gas.",2020.0
7343,JPMORGAN,"We also include methane emissions in addition to carbon dioxide, because methane is a critical component of the overall global warming impact of the sector.",2020.0

7348,JPMORGAN,"Carbon intensity metrics will most effectively enable us to evaluate performance at the sector and the company levels, inform our engagement with our clients and make capital allocation decisions.",2020.0
7349,JPMORGAN,Evaluating these changes in performance is crucial in an economy that needs to meet the Paris objectives while still generating energy for the world’s growing needs.,2020.0
7350,JPMORGAN,"More specifically, carbon intensity is decision-useful and impact- oriented because it: ] Allows us to set informative targets that are aligned with science-based scenarios, which require constraining total emissions on a pathway that ultimately achieves net zero ] Enables us to meaningfully engage with new and existing clients and provide the capital necessary to help finance their transition, while reducing the carbon intensity of our portfolio ] Enables us to evaluate both individual companies’ and whole sectors’ performance against decarbonization trajectories that must be achieved to align with the Paris Agreement ] More effectively reflects the progress that high-emitting companies and sectors are making in transitioning to lower- carbon production and products ] Allows for easier comparison across a portfolio of companies within a sector and between companies of different sizes ] Is less affected than absolute emissions by year-to-year emissions volatility, such as changes in companies’ production ] Avoids attributing market volatility (e.",2020.0

7352,JPMORGAN,"Beyond our three starting sectors in particular, measuring company emissions remains a significant challenge.",2020.0
7353,JPMORGAN,"Going forward, we will explore different ways to engage with industry on improving emissions data and aim to update our methodology to reflect improvements over time.",2020.0
7354,JPMORGAN,"How We Will Drive Progress Going forward, we intend to align our lending and underwriting decisions in our chosen sectors to work toward achieving our portfolio targets, which means we will work to increasingly support those companies that are helping advance the goals of the Paris Agreement, such as by expanding their investment in low- and zero-carbon energy sources and technologies and reducing their GHG emissions.",2020.0
7355,JPMORGAN,Measuring emissions performance metrics and stated targets will be a key factor in how we evaluate and make decisions about financing of clients in our chosen sectors.,2020.0
