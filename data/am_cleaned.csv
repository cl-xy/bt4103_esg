to map the likely winners and losers, notably based on scenario analysis and the extent to which long-term climate risks are reflected in our credit views and bond prices, and, if they are not, what this could mean for issuers’ credit quality considering bond characteristics (e', ' Example B: Sovereign creditOur sovereign credit climate score comprises a host of metrics that capture each country’s exposure and readiness to cope with climate change, connecting environmental with economic variables', ' Conversely, rising temperatures and physical climate risks are likely to disproportionally affect the credit risk of developed and smaller countries', ' Our environmental assessment for real estate examines practices in terms of green buildings and like-for-like carbon emissions, energy intensity reductions, and reduction of physical risks', 'Looking across subsectors, our climate scores for REITs (real estate investment trusts) suggest that malls and offices are generally the most advanced in their practices and trajectories', 'Example D: Municipal bondsPIMCO’s municipal climate score considers a variety of factors to assess the economic vulnerability associated with climate risks, as well as the ability and willingness of states and local governments to adapt and achieve sustainable initiatives', ' 35Climate Tool #4: Portfolio Energy and

show progress in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I), community engagement, and climate change', ' To reach higher in our commitment to environmental sustainability and the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have adopted a rigorous approach to curtail our corporate carbon footprint and set challenging goals for our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions', ' To that end, in 2020 our Board amended one of our committee charters to include climate change as a specific area of focus', ' We believe this decision is indicative of the importance our organization gives to the threat of a

Social & Governance ReportS P OT L I G H TOur View of the Climate ChallengeAddressing climate change and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement is a global imperative; yet, doing so requires overcoming major challenges', ' Reducing GHG emissions — the main cause of climate change — will require collective ambition and cooperation across the public and private sectors', 'The primary sources of GHG emissions — coal, oil and natural gas — have powered the world’s energy economy for many decades, in the process advancing significant economic growth and social development for billions of people around the world', ' And we need to do so by using lower-carbon technologies so that the world can meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement', 'Currently there are not adequate, commercially available low-carbon energy solutions for all of the world’s energy needs', '13 And, even as this scales up, electricity generation still accounts for only about 44% of global carbon dioxide emissions', 'As a result, even as additional low-carbon technologies are developed and deployed over time, resources like oil and natural gas will continue to play a role in meeting essential global energy needs', ' To that end, our firm continues to actively support market-based policy solutions, including a price on carbon (see page 57) and the commercialization of new technologies that can help advance deep decarbonization', ' This means we are measuring the GHG emissions of our clients in key sectors of our financing portfolio (our “financed emissions”) and are setting reduction targets for these sector portfolios that are Paris-aligned', ' To start, we have developed intermediate Paris-aligned targets to reduce the carbon intensity in our Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing portfolios by 2030', ' Why We Made This CommitmentOur commitment to Paris-alignment is an important step toward accelerating the low-carbon energy transition and encouraging near-term actions that will set a path for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050', 'Our Paris-aligned financing commitment is the next step in our journey to mobilize our business to respond to our clients’ needs and help address climate change', ' Our Approach to Paris-AlignmentJPMorgan Chase has developed Carbon CompassSM — our methodology to measure and track progress against our Paris-aligned targets', ' Our targets are based on credible third-party energy and emissions scenarios, such as the International Energy Agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario (IEA SDS) and the Energy Technology Perspectives Beyond 2°C Scenario (ETP B2DS), which include specific glide paths to achieve Paris-aligned emissions', ' First, these sectors are each responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions in the global energy value chain, making them key to bringing overall emissions trajectories in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement', ' Third, though improvements are needed, sufficient emissions data is emerging in each of these sectors', ' For example, a lower-carbon power grid is a key enabler of decarbonization in the auto sector, as electric vehicles are only truly low- or zero-emission if charged by lower carbon or renewably powered electricity', ' In establishing our methodology, we enlisted the support of ERM — a global pure-play sustainability consultancy with deep sectoral, technical and business expertise in the low carbon and energy transition — to challenge and enhance our efforts', ' See our Carbon Compass Methodology for more details on our overall process and sector-specific details', '492020 Environmental, Social & Governance ReportCurrent Portfolio and 2030 Portfolio TargetsThe metrics in the table below summarize the financed

'Highlights of Our Carbon CompassSM MethodologyOur approach incorporates what we believe are the most relevant, impactful, credible and decision-useful data and metrics to drive progress', ' To be effective, we know the metrics we use and the emissions we measure must be based on activities that generate the most GHG emissions for each sector and that are most important for each company’s transition pathway', ' For example, in the Oil & Gas sector, we include both operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions from the production and refining of oil and gas, and end-use (Scope 3) emissions associated with the ultimate combustion of that oil and gas', ' We also include methane emissions in addition to carbon dioxide, because methane is a critical component of the overall global warming impact of the sector', ' light trucks can constitute up to 30% of global passenger vehicle sales, making these vehicles material for overall emissions and for a company’s ability to transition to a lower-carbon fleet', '502020 Environmental, Social & Governance ReportUse carbon intensity because it is the most decision-useful metric for our commitment', ' The primary metric we are currently using to measure company and our portfolio performance is carbon intensity, which expresses emissions relative to a given unit of output (e', ', kilograms of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of electricity generation) rather than in absolute terms (e', ' Carbon intensity metrics will most effectively enable us to evaluate performance at the sector and the company levels, inform our engagement with our clients and make capital allocation decisions', 'More specifically, carbon intensity is decision-useful and impact- oriented because it:] Allows us to set informative targets that are aligned with science-based scenarios, which require constraining total emissions on a pathway that ultimately achieves net zero] Enables us to meaningfully engage with new and existing clients and provide the capital necessary to help finance their transition, while reducing the carbon intensity of our portfolio] Enables us to evaluate both individual companies’ and whole sectors’ performance against decarbonization trajectories that must be achieved to align with the Paris Agreement ] More effectively reflects the progress that high-emitting companies and sectors are making in

company’s emissions, which can result in incorrect signals about a client’s underlying emissions performanceBase calculations on best available data — and advocate for better data', ' Beyond our three starting sectors in particular, measuring company emissions remains a significant challenge', ' Going forward, we will explore different ways to engage with industry on improving emissions data and aim to update our methodology to reflect improvements over time', 'How We Will Drive ProgressGoing forward, we intend to align our lending and underwriting decisions in our chosen sectors to work toward achieving our portfolio targets, which means we will work to increasingly support those companies that are helping advance the goals of the Paris Agreement, such as by expanding their investment in low- and zero-carbon energy sources and technologies and reducing their GHG emissions', ' Measuring emissions performance metrics and stated targets will be a key factor in how we evaluate and make decisions about financing of clients in our chosen sectors', ' While our 2030 portfolio targets are primarily based on carbon intensity metrics, we will consider a variety of performance indicators in our financing decisions, such as our clients’ own transition-related forward-looking commitments, business strategies and capital planning', 'In 2020, our firm committed to

availability challenges, particularly for SMEs where carbon emissions data is limited, we utilised geographical and sectoral emissions as proxies', ' Borrowers’ carbon emissions were converted to a common “carbon to revenue” metric which we then used to assess the financial impact of transition risk over short-, medium- and long-term horizons', ' industry associations and climate specialists to progress collectively towards a more robust approach on climate scenario analysis as methodologies and tools evolve and mature', ' Using our credit rating models, we simulated the impact of the financial cost resulting from the carbon price increase under each scenario on these borrowers’ credit rating', ' On average, we observed credit rating deterioration of two notches across these 382 borrowers in the High Carbon Price Scenario, with borrowers in the most carbon-intensive segments such as building materials, experiencing more significant impact', ' Based on a sample of 68 borrowers (six per cent of non-bank loans), we observed negligible credit rating deterioration in the High Carbon Price Scenario given the relatively low carbon intensity of the sector', ' Notably, the methodology primarily attempts to quantify the impact of carbon price increase on borrowers’ financials without explicitly factoring in other plausible impacts such as changes in market demand on

types of greenhouse gases', ' For example, one tonne of methane would be equal to about 25 tonnes of CO2e, because it has a global warming potential that is approximately 25 times that of one tonne of carbon dioxide', 'Climate change and global warmingThe increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s climate system, apparent since the mid- to late-20th century', ' Climate change is attributed primarily to the higher amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere resulting from the burning of fossil fuel, the production of industrial products, livestock farming, crop fertilisation and deforestation', ' The primary greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride', 'Global warming potentialA measure of the amount of heat a greenhouse gas is able to trap in the atmosphere relative to carbon dioxide gas', ' Chronic physical risk arises from longer-term shifts in climate patterns such as rising sea levels with time horizon typically spanning decades', 'Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissionsDirect emissions that originate from operations or assets which are owned or controlled by the organisation including on-site generation of electricity, steam or heat in equipment, travel in cars and other vehicles owned or controlled by the company and hydrofluorocarbons emitted from refrigeration or air-conditioning equipment', 'Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissionsIndirect emissions resulting from the generation of grid electricity, heat or steam by an outside organisation, such as an electricity provider, but which is utilised by the reporting organisation', 'Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissionsAll other indirect emissions which occur at sources the organisation neither owns nor controls', ' Scope 3 emissions can result from business travel in non-company vehicles, especially commercial planes; employees commuting in non-company vehicles, as well as the activities of suppliers, customers and contractors', 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)Industry-led initiative established by the Financial Stability Board in 2015 at the request of the G20 to develop a set of voluntary climate-related financial risk disclosures which can be adopted by companies so that those companies can inform investors and other members of the public about the risks they face related to climate change', ' The recommendations of the TCFD are organised around four pillars, namely governance and management, strategy, management of climate change-related risks and metrics and targets in place to address the impacts', 'Transition risksTransition risks arise from the process of adjustment towards a low-carbon economy which could result in financial and non-financial impacts', ' Our

investment strategies', ' It also involves our investments in companies benefitting from the energy transition and climate-change challenge', ' More recently, we have done a lot of work in defining our approach to sustainability, with a particular focus on climate change', ' This means we support investing that is aligned with the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner', ' Our approach to net zeroBy joining the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, we have embarked on what may be our most important project since our inception – the quest to help curtail disruptive climate change and ensure the long-term sustainability of our planet', ' The carbon-intensive emerging market economies in particular need time, encouragement and resources to adjust', 'In our drive for low-emitting portfolios, we intend to do more than reduce carbon by simply constructing portfolios that exclude high-emitting countries and companies', 'Instead, we seek to differentiate between the reduction of ̒portfolio carbon’ and the reduction of carbon emissions in the real world', ' Currently, companies are incentivised to divest carbon-heavy assets to report declining carbon intensity', ' At the same time, countries are incentivised to ‘offshore’ carbon emissions to other countries, which does not change domestic consumption patterns', 'As currently measured, the carbon footprint of a portfolio depends far more on sector and regional allocations than on the progress of the underlying companies', ' A narrow focus on lowering ‘reported carbon intensity’ is therefore likely to divert capital out of the developing world', ' Instead of risking a disorderly exit from carbon-intensive economies, sectors and companies with a high carbon footprint, we will, where we can exert influence, actively allocate to companies and countries that can be encouraged to deliver on transition plans', 'We aim to do this within our three-dimensional sustainability framework:InvestWe will endeavour to understand climate risk and transition opportunities to the best of our abilities', ' We believe that accurately priced risk will result in allocations to companies and countries working hardest to curb emissions', ' The interrogation of relevant externalities, including emissions, will result in the best investment outcomes for clients over time', ' While we are already carbon neutral due to our mitigation programme on our known and controllable direct footprint, we must go further to reduce the footprint itself', ' In addition to this disclosure, we will also aim to report to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for the first time as a listed company later in 2021', ' 15At a policy level, we continue to lean on our climate-change statement in our Stewardship Policy, which sets out our commitment to integration, measurement and engagement', ' Oversight of how we deliver against this policy and the climate-change statement rests with the Sustainability Committee and is reported to the Ninety One Board', ' On a day-to-day basis, the investment teams continue to be responsible for understanding and integrating climate risk into their fundamental analysis', ' We place considerable importance on advocacy around climate change and have been involved with local efforts in South Africa, addressing transition-finance options for the national energy utility, Eskom', ' We are an active participant in the work that the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) is leading on, including the Paris Aligned Investment Initiatives and the Net Zero Investment Framework, which we were involved in developing', ' We have also contributed to CDP disclosure efforts, with success, and have joined the Say on Climate Initiative', ' Our Investment Institute is an important

relevant subject-matter experts across the firm (the “Working Group”) to conduct enterprise-level climate scenario analysis', ' The exercise was conducted to assess climate-related risks and opportunities and the resilience of BlackRock’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios', ' The journey of both conceptualizing and modelling our climate scenario analysis was a challenging one – and will evolve as standards around data and scenarios emerge across the industry', ' Nonetheless, given the critical and urgent need to incorporate effective climate scenario analysis into companies’ long-term strategic planning, including BlackRock’s, we sought to establish a framework that we could build upon over time', 'BackgroundTo appropriately incorporate the potential effects of climate change into organizations’ planning processes, the TCFD states that businesses “need to consider how climate-related risks and opportunities may evolve and their potential business implications under different conditions', '”1Larry Fink’s 2020 Letter to CEO’s underscored the importance of climate scenario analysis by asking the companies in which BlackRock invests on behalf of our clients to disclose their “plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized', ' In the case of climate change, climate-related scenario analysis allows an organization to develop insight into how climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities might impact the business over time', ' While scenario analysis is a well-established method for BlackRock that is used in our strategic planning, the incorporation of climate-related scenarios represented a significant advancement, particularly as climate scenarios reflect a much longer time horizon than other types of scenarios typically utilized for financial planning', ' Importantly, the objective of

the analysisBlackRock 2020 TCFD Report42Risk IdentificationThe Working Group evaluated climate-related risks relevant to BlackRock’s business referencing guidance provided by the TCFD', ' Importantly, as discussed on page 23 of this report, BlackRock’s exposure to climate-related risk is primarily indirect, affecting potential future revenue and expenses, rather than our balance sheet', ' The Working Group determined that BlackRock’s enterprise climate scenario analysis should focus on climate-related impacts to: 1) the valuation of assets under management (“AUM”) and the associated management fees generated by that AUM, and 2) flows into and out of BlackRock product offerings due to changing client preferences or regulation', '4 Based on the conclusions from our risk identification process, the Working Group determined that the most relevant climate scenario would emerge from an event that had a significant impact on asset valuations and associated management fees as well as client flows into and out of BlackRock products and amongst different products managed by BlackRock due to asset class and investment strategy re-allocation', ' The top scenarios considered by the Working Group were the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) Sustainable Development Scenario (“SDS”), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) Representative Concentration Pathway

climate-related opportunities under the ‘Optimistic’ outcome and BlackRock’s business resilience to climate-related risks in the case of an ‘Adverse’ outcome', ' The Optimistic outcome assumes the following occurs after the market shock in 2023:•IPR policy changes are successfully implemented in a global and coordinated manner, and financial market valuations grow at a lower, but steady pace• ESG products outperform and clients’ preferences towards ESG products accelerate, causing inflows to sustainable iShares as clients re-allocate portfolios towards sustainable products• BlackRock’s active products successfully anticipate the policy shift due to effective ESG integration and the sophistication of BlackRock’s Aladdin Climate analytics, which leads to outperformance of active strategies• Public opinion on the need to act decisively to address climate change aligns, which positively affects BlackRock’s reputation, recognizing that a portion of reputational risk BlackRock faces today results from divergent views across stakeholders and regulators on the topic of climate action •There is increased demand for BlackRock’s Alternatives products, particularly BlackRock’s Global Renewable Power platform• As a result, BlackRock grows AUM organically and preserves leadership position in industryBlackRock 2020 TCFD Report44The Adverse outcome assumes the following occurs after the market shock in 2023:• Policies are announced but fail to get implemented in line with expectations,7 leading to policy fragmentation', ' Alternatively BlackRock’s sustainable products do not align with certain regulators’ definitions of sustainable products• BlackRock experiences outflows and loses market share both in ESG and non-ESG productsResults and conclusionsThe results of the scenario analysis indicate that despite a lack of direct exposure to climate-related risks, a scenario similar to the IPR could materially impact the value of BlackRock’s AUM and associated revenues, profit, and market share', ' As such, BlackRock may be vulnerable to climate-related transition risks if BlackRock is not strategically positioned to capitalize on rapid market shifts due to climate-related policy including fragmented policy implementation across jurisdictions', ' The results of the analysis reinforce the importance of both the continued investment in these capabilities including Aladdin Climate, ESG integration, investment stewardship, and the expansion of sustainable product offerings', 'Limitations of the analysisThe climate scenario analysis provided a structured way to evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities – both in a quantitative and qualitative manner, and it opened a wider discussion across the firm with respect to how climate transition risks could affect our business', ' First, a comprehensive climate-related scenario analysis should assess the potential implications of both physical and transition risk', ' As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold and the intentions of the US Presidential Administration on climate policy become clear, policy forecasts will also evolve to account for additional developments and potential

zero, we are introducing a climate alignment assessment for each company that shows how far their business aligns or plans to align with a 1', ' This sits alongside our ‘Environmental’ rating that grades 4000+ companies on characteristics such as emissions reduction, water usage, biodiversity, and climate risk, within our proprietary ESG ratings framework', ' Separately, our macro team is

Salman Ahmed Global Head of Macro and SAA and Anna Stupnytska Global Macro Economist Climate change, and the policies aimed at slowing it, will shape the path of economic growth this century', ' Policymakers face a trade-off between the high upfront cost of moving quickly towards net-zero carbon targets, and the long-term physical damage to economies and societal cohesion caused by rising temperatures and extreme weather events if they delay action', ' As a result, macroeconomic projections at the core of Fidelity International’s capital market assumptions (CMAs) must incorporate both these physical climate risks and policy transition risks for a more complete picture of long-term returns in the 21st century', 'Global macroeconomic growth has been fuelled by cheap sources of carbon-based energy for over a century', ' Transition risks refer to the effects of restructuring the economy, for example through new rules or surcharges that limit carbon emissions or through changes in consumer behaviour, to respond to the threat of climate change', ' For example, physical risks decline relative to pessimistic warming scenarios, if measures to reduce emissions and slow temperature rises are taken decisively and early on', '9Our approach Our approach to incorporating climate risks into our CMA calculations starts by choosing a set of scenarios run by the climate modelling community, with different assumptions about greenhouse gas emissions, societal choices, technology, adaptation and mitigation policies', ' We use the climate scenarios produced by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) - a network of central banks and supervisors - to get macroeconomic projections for key economies to 2100 under the chosen scenarios', ' The scenarios are broadly divided into: “orderly”, in which climate policies are introduced early minimising both transition and physical risks, “disorderly,” in which policy changes are delayed increasing transition costs, and “hot house world,” under which global efforts are insufficient to halt significant global warming leading to severe physical risks', ' We chose the NGFS framework to ensure that our tools are consistent with those used by central banks and supervisors to perform their own climate stress tests', ' The GDP, inflation and interest rate trajectories produced by these scenarios will then be mapped onto our models for estimating the potential effect of transition and physical risks of climate change on long-term capital market assumptions and strategic asset allocation', ' Climate change uncertainty and policy credibility Nobody knows for sure what path climate change and emissions policy will take in the next decade, let alone the century', ' For example, the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures standard is being adopted in several countries around the world, but the EU has its own more stringent climate reporting (the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) that could eventually become the norm', ' Only investment managers who offer high-scoring ESG strategies will attract and retain clients, and it will become harder to justify owning carbon-intensive companies with no plans to clean up their act', ' These forces could alter fund flows and market valuations, and ultimately, accelerate the low-carbon transition', ' We now expect a surge in regulation and incentives to help achieve these emissions reduction targets, initially through better disclosure', ' They must report their alignment with the two climate goals, and not invest in companies that “do significant harm”, though it is not yet clear what significant harm means', 'Ensuring investments are sustainable Europe may have a reputation for sometimes being overly bureaucratic, but its sharp focus on ESG has made it a world leader on sustainability, with the highest climate-related disclosure rates', 'To date, the green taxonomy only covers the first two of the EU’s six environmental goals listed below, but it is expected that future taxonomies will cover the remaining four climate goals, plus additional social goals', ' Regulatory wave will soon sort

assess the impact on financial assets, operational income and physical assets)', ' Our subsequent (2015) bottom-up analyses of oil and gas utilities as well as electric utilities loan portfolios consisted of a forward-looking analysis to assess impacts of a long-term low fossil fuel price scenario resulting from policies promoting greater use of renewables, enhancing efficiency standards and limiting emissions', ' However, we identified methodological challenges ranging from the suitability of climate scenarios for banking risk modelling to data availability', ' The objective is to develop analytical tools that help banks define and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities as envisioned by the TCFD', ' Now in its second phase, the UNEP FI TCFD working group for banks has grown to 35 banks and has expanded the development of these analytical tools to include a range of possible scenarios, further advancement on scenario-based stress testing methodologies, and standardization between institutions on what defines climate-sensitive activities', ' These advancements aim for banks to more robustly identify and disclose exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities', ' In the context of the PACTA pilot, we studied the alignment of select climate-sensitive sectors in our corporate credit portfolio with Paris Agreement benchmarks', ' The methodology

EffortsA signatory of the UN-supported Principals for Responsible Investment (PRI) since 2012, we were named to the 2020 PRI Leaders’ Group for our efforts to assess, manage and disclose climate risk and opportunity across our investment strategies', 'Drawing on insights from our Climate Value-at-Risk scenario analysis, we reaffirmed our growing concern about the unsustainability of thermal coal from an environmental and financial perspective', ' For example, we voted in support of a shareholder proposal to require more meaningful diversity reporting at a major hotelier, but we voted against increased greenhouse-gas-reduction reporting from an energy company that we believed had already been very detailed in its disclosures and in its commitment to net-zero carbon emissions', ' Having met those targets for 2020, we remain ambitious in our goals for the coming years to deliver on diversity initiatives and more firmly establish our plans to achieve net-zero emissions', ' In all of our efforts, the need for transparency is clear, as reflected in our corporate ESG and climate policies, our ongoing efforts to inspire positive ESG practices that can benefit the performance of such companies and reduce exposure to certain risks via individual corporate engagements, and our NB Votes program', ' As a PRI Leader, we take our commitment on climate seriously, and plan to continue influencing our peers and portfolio companies to enhance disclosures and practices associated with climate-related impact', ' As the world renews its consensus around solving for climate change, inequality and accountability, we believe that our focus on ESG factors across portfolios will provide meaningful performance benefits over time', ' “ We have seen all too clearly that the crises of our time—Covid-19, climate change, discrimination and inequity—can only be solved with the enthusiastic involvement of business', ' We believe incorporating ESG considerations has become an increasingly important component of our solutions: to inform investment research for better return-seeking decisions; to seek to understand and manage risks such as the effects of climate change; and to help meet our clients’ unique sustainability objectives', ' This allows us to help fulfill our clients’ sustainability objectives by delivering multi-asset solutions that reflect the findings of our proprietary ESG Quotient, climate value-at-risk and diversity measures, as well as highlight Neuberger Berman’s engagement activities on ESG issues', ' For example, among structured products we introduced a new framework for analyzing climate risk in mortgage backed securities, and a new approach to assessing affordability and lending practices for asset-backed securities', ' Looking for ImpactThis year, we witnessed an increased interest from our limited partners in ESG and impact investing, diversity and inclusion, and climate transition strategies', ' We then employ three broad tools to measure performance in each category: available third-party ESG data, ESG data from NB’s Data Science team and, most significantly, input from our research analysts on hard-to-measure factors such as regulatory risk, expected governance impacts and forward-looking data such as climate-related targets', ' The company provided us with estimates of what portion of historical emissions the assets represented and we were then able to adjust the inputs to our ratings—resulting in what we believe to be an improved and more forward-looking view through collaboration with the covering analyst', 'OUR INVESTMENT APPROACH2020 ESG ANNUAL REPORT 15NB Impact ThemesS O C I A LDeliver sustainable growth and fair employmentIncrease positive health and safety outcomesPromote gender and

APPROACH2020 ESG ANNUAL REPORT 19Climate Change in Focus In 2021, as the coronavirus crisis subsides, we think climate change will reclaim its place at the top of the agenda', ' We believe it affects business in two major ways: through direct physical impact and the transition to a low-carbon economy', ' Carbon taxes, regulation, green fiscal spending, energy transitions and changing purchasing behavior are likely to create new winners and losers', ' That is why we developed a comprehensive Climate-related Corporate Strategy three years ago, to reflect the growing climate risks in our

BuckleyVanguard Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerInvestors come to Vanguard for many reasons', ' Vanguard cares deeply about the impact of climate risk, and we expect company boards to be aware of their role in the changing climate', ' Every company, whether it’s a carbon producer or a carbon consumer, factors into the climate equation', ' At companies for which climate risk is material, we expect boards to oversee that risk, demonstrate competency on climate issues, provide effective disclosure, and take appropriate steps to mitigate the risks for their business', 'The AmericasOur engagements with companies in the Americas this proxy year centered on understanding how boards identify and oversee material risks, including climate- and diversity-related risks, and how they disclose those to the market', ' These proposals varied widely, from aligning long-term strategy with climate risks to seeking targets for reducing companies’ climate impact', ' Companies were asked to disclose their strategies for managing and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and aligning with goals set forth in the Paris Agreement', ' We also saw more climate-related proposals outside carbon-intensive industries, such as at financial firms, as shareholders looked for disclosure of climate-related risks in lending activities and, in some cases, asked those firms to stop financing activities in the energy and utilities sectors', 'Vanguard expects boards to effectively oversee climate risks and become more transparent about their decision-making process through clear and effective disclosure', ' We support the use of investor-oriented frameworks such as those developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 10Disclosures (TCFD) to enable better disclosure', ' The Paris Agreement goals have become a widely accepted standard for countries and companies aiming to address climate change', ' Where climate change is a material risk, Vanguard encourages companies to set and disclose targets that align with these goals, and to both assess and communicate their progress', 'In addition to climate change and diversity, political spending and lobbying proposals appeared on the ballot across nearly every sector', 'Amid a heightened public awareness of environmental issues, investor activism continued to rise in Europe, and we carefully assessed a small number of climate-related shareholder proposals', ' In some cases, boards were more transparent, willing to acknowledge theirAustralia and New ZealandPublic and regulatory attention to climate risk markedly increased this proxy year in Australia and New Zealand, including from government agencies with oversight of disclosure practices by companies generally, and prudential supervision specifically in the case of financial sector institutions', 'The 2019 Australian proxy season brought an uptick in both climate-related shareholder proposals and the number of energy companies whose climate-related disclosures align with the TFCD’s standards, which we support', ' More leading companies in the region now aspire to address emissions targets, scenario analysis, and carbon-neutral goals as laid out in the Paris Agreement', 'Although there is still room for improvement, we appreciate that these companies now recognize the directional expectations of investors and are being proactive about their governance policies at a time when the bushfires that ravaged Australia in 2019 and 2020 have put climate change at the center of a national conversation', '21Oversight of strategy and riskClimate changeProposals seek greater climate-change disclosureCompanies in many sectors received shareholder proposals that sought greater disclosure on climate-change impacts and strategy alignments with the Paris Agreement, among other requests', ' We encourage companies to align their reporting with the TCFD, an industry group that developed consistent frameworks that enable companies and shareholders to measure and respond to climate-change risks', ' We analyze each proposal case by case using a flexible process, and we continually advance our understanding of climate-governance best practices', '22Rio Tinto is pressed on Scope 3 emissionsTwo energy companies are asked to align with the Paris AgreementOversight of strategy and riskClimate changeWe engaged with Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian metals and mining company, to discuss a climate-related shareholder proposal at its 2020 annual meeting', ' The proponent called on the firm to disclose short-, medium-, and long-term targets and performance for its Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions', 'Rio Tinto had already announced several climate-change targets, including a 30% reduction in its emissions intensity by 2030, a 15% reduction in absolute emissions by 2030, and net-zero emissions by 2050', 'When we met with Rio Tinto, the chairman explained that the firm’s business mix made it challenging to set meaningful Scope 3 emissions targets', ' Rio Tinto does not produce or sell carbon, so it cannot easily reduce its Scope 3 emissions by exiting a business line', ' In fact, most of its Scope 3 emissions relate to the use of the commodities it mines, which means a high exposure to the carbon-intensive activities associated with aluminum smelting and steelmaking', ' As a result, Rio Tinto has focused on developing partnerships to address the carbon intensity of steel and to evaluate the aluminum value chain', 'We recognize Rio Tinto’s business-specific challenges but expressed the need for better disclosure about its partnerships, including explicit information on how these partnerships help reduce the company’s Scope 3 emissions', 'At this time, Rio Tinto does not appear to be in a position to set meaningful targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions, so we decided it was too early to support the binding shareholder proposal', 'Although both companies have room for improvement—a point we raised in our engagements—each has made progress and commitments on disclosure, primarily regarding Scope 1 and 2 emissions', ' Santos, for example, has embraced carbon capture technology and aligned its reporting with the TCFD framework', ' Disclosure about Scope 3 emissions in the energy industry is more nascent and, we believe, needs more time to mature before being mandated as the shareholder proposals outlined', ' But we are closely monitoring industry conversations about Scope 3 emissions and look forward to seeing Scope 3 disclosures evolve in the energy industry', 'Categories of greenhouse gas emissionsScope 1 emissions: Direct greenhouse emissions from a firm’s activities or aspects under its control', 'Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect emissions from a firm’s activities, occurring from sources it doesn’t own or control', 'In the past, shareholders have expressed concern that the combined role of CEO and chair inhibits feedback on important governance matters, such as oversight of climate risk', ' Investors have expressed that strengthening independent leadership would help drive strategic changes on important oversight matters, including Exxon’s oversight, disclosure, and approach to climate change', 'iA Financial is asked to enhance its climate-change reportingiA Financial, a Canadian insurance company, received three shareholder proposals that asked the board to produce a Oversight of strategy and riskClimate changereport that analyzes climate change’s impacts on the business, to adopt objectives that reduce the environmental impacts, and to hire experts to help the company guide its sustainability efforts', 'They also shared how Dollar Tree has taken meaningful steps to improve its sustainability reporting and has publicly committed to disclosing its GHG emissions disclosures and long-term goals by next year’s annual meeting', 'In our engagement, the board chairman and company executives explained that they consider climate change as part of their risk oversight process and said that a separate board committee focuses on ESG matters', 'Ultimately, the funds voted in favor of one of the proposals that asked for a climate report, because the company’s disclosures lagged those of peers and touched only on direct emissions targets', ' Based on our analysis of the myriad ways that climate change can affect insurers, we believe that climate change puts certain insured assets at a greater risk of loss', 'The funds did not support the proposal that sought climate impact-reduction objectives, because iA Financial already assesses its environmental impact targets internally and plans to disclose its assessment in the near term', 'Dollar Tree takes positive steps toward climate disclosuresClimate change extends beyond obvious sectors such as energy and transportation', ' When we engage with boards in consumer-related industries, we regularly discuss climate risk and related sustainability topics', 'We met with Dollar Tree, an operator of discount retail stores, to discuss a shareholder proposal asking for a report that aligns the company’s long-term business strategy with the projected long-term constraints posed by climate change', ' We viewed the proposal as a reasonable request for greater disclosure, allowing the company flexibility in reporting on its management of GHG emissions', 'Shareholder proposal prompts climate discussion at BarclaysAt Barclays’ 2020 annual meeting, a shareholder proposal asked the board of the U', 'Through several discussions, Barclays’ board chair and company leaders explained that the company thought the spirit of the shareholder request—to do more on climate—was reasonable', 'We were pleased to hear a candid assessment by the board chair of Barclays’ approach to climate change and how the company intended to improve upon—and even in some cases go beyond—what peers were doing on this topic', ' Our discussions made clear that the chair was well-informed and committed to meaningful progress on both addressing climate-related risks and disclosing how Barclays is meeting targets that align with the Paris Agreement', ' To that end, the company had decided to put forth its own climate-related proposal, which set ambitious goals to become net zero on all GHG emissions by 2050 in alignment with the Paris Agreement, to disclose targets and strategy, and to report annually on progress', 'Two other proposals—an advisory vote on executive compensation and a shareholder request for disclosure of GHG emissions within the

increased greenhouse-gas-reduction reporting from an energy company that we believed had already been very detailed in its disclosures and in its commitment to net-zero carbon emissions', ' Having met

our time—Covid-19, climate change, discrimination and inequity—can only be solved with the enthusiastic involvement of business', ' We believe incorporating ESG considerations has become an

things: schoolchildren protesting about climate change, international accords on carbon emissions, the inequalities revealed by coronavirus, the sudden outbreak of devastating wildfires around the world, the emergence of headline-grabbing companies at the forefront of sustainable solutions, the increasing availability of investment tools', ' When we were defining the Fund’s ESG framework, I found the SDGs really useful as a reminder that investing with purpose is about more than just climate risk and the usual environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics', 'Climate change risk is an important consideration, nonetheless, and the Fund has made substantial progress on cutting carbon emissions in its portfolio, as well as implementing a thermal coal exclusion policy', 'Shukla: Our
